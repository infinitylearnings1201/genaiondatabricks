# MAGIC # Demo: Setting Up and Managing LakeFlow Jobs using UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we'll set up a Databricks Lakeflow Jobs that automates a series of MLOps tasks such as data quality assessment, feature importance analysis, and alerting on unusual patterns. These tasks help ensure data readiness and provide insights before moving to model training. We’ll also introduce a conditional path based on the detection of unusual patterns.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Learning Objectives:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we will:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Create and configure a Databricks Lakeflow job with multiple Python script tasks.
# MAGIC - Set dependencies and conditional paths between tasks.
# MAGIC - Enable email notifications for successful job runs.
# MAGIC - Manually trigger the workflow.
# MAGIC - Monitor the job's execution and completion.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC 1. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC    - In the drop-down, select **More**.
# MAGIC    - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** pop-up, select the first drop-down. You will see a unique cluster name in that drop-down. Please select that cluster.
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC 1. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC 1. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC 1. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.

# MAGIC ## Requirements
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Please review the following requirements before starting the lesson:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - To run this notebook, you need to use one of the following Databricks runtime(s): `16.3.x-cpu-ml-scala2.12`

# MAGIC ### Task 2.1: Data Quality Assessment
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Create First Task**:
# MAGIC    - Name the task `Data_Quality_Assessment`.
# MAGIC    - Set **Type** to `Notebook`.
# MAGIC    - **Source** should be set to `Workspace`.
# MAGIC    - Set **Path** to the notebook for data quality assessment (e.g., `/1.1 Demo Pipeline - Data Quality and Feature Analysis/1.1a - Data Quality Assessment`).
# MAGIC    - Select an `Serverless` cluster for this task.
# MAGIC    - Click **Create Task**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This task will check for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and generate a data quality report.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Task 2.2: Alert on Unusual Patterns
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Create Second Task**:
# MAGIC    - Click on **Add Task --> Notebook**.

# MAGIC    - Use the same `Serverless` cluster as the previous task.
# MAGIC    - Set **Depends on** to `Data_Quality_Assessment` to ensure this task runs after data quality checks.
# MAGIC    - Click **Create Task**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This task will check for unusual patterns, such as high cardinality and skewed distributions, setting a flag if any unusual patterns are detected.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Task 2.3: Conditional Path Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Create Condition for Unusual Patterns**:
# MAGIC    - Click on **Add Task --> If/else condition.**
# MAGIC    - Name the condition task `Alert_Unusual_Patterns_True`.
# MAGIC    - Set **Type** to `If/else condition`.
# MAGIC    - **Condition**: Set the expression to **&lcub;&lcub;tasks.Alert_Unusual_Patterns.values.unusual_pattern_status&rcub;&rcub; == unusual_pattern_detected**.
# MAGIC    - Set **Depends on** to `Alert_Unusual_Patterns` to ensure this condition is evaluated after the unusual patterns check.
# MAGIC    - This condition will branch based on whether unusual patterns are detected (`True`) or not (`False`).
# MAGIC    - Click **Save Task**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This conditional setup directs the workflow to either investigate unusual patterns (if detected) or proceed with feature importance analysis if no patterns are detected.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Task 2.6: Save Report (Final Task)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Create Fifth Task**:
# MAGIC    - Click on **Add Task --> Notebook**.

# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, you learned how to:
# MAGIC - Configure and execute a Databricks LakeFlow Jobs with multiple tasks for data quality, feature importance, and unusual pattern checks.
# MAGIC - Use dependencies and conditional paths to control the flow of tasks based on the data conditions.
# MAGIC - Set up email notifications to stay updated on job execution.
# MAGIC - Trigger the Job manually and monitor its execution.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This workflow serves as a preliminary step to ensure data quality and feature insights before moving on to model training. By automating these MLOps setup tasks and handling conditional paths, you can ensure a robust pipeline that adapts based on data characteristics, providing insights and addressing issues early in the MLOps process.
