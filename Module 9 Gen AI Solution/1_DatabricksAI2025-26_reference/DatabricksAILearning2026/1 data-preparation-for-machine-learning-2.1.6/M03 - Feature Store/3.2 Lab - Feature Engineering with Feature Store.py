# MAGIC # LAB - Feature Engineering with Feature Store
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Welcome to the "Feature Engineering with Feature Store" In this lesson, you will learn how to load and prepare a dataset for feature selection, explore and manipulate a feature table through Databricks UI, perform feature selection on specific columns, create a new feature table, access feature table details using both UI and API, merge two feature tables based on a common identifier, and efficiently delete unnecessary feature tables. Get ready to enhance your feature engineering skills—let's dive in!

# MAGIC **Lab Outline:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this Lab, you will learn how to:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Load and Prepare Dataset for Feature Selection
# MAGIC 2. Explore Feature Table through UI
# MAGIC 3. Access Feature Table Information
# MAGIC 4. Create Feature Table from Existing UC Table
# MAGIC 5. Enhance Feature Table with New Features
# MAGIC 6. Efficient Feature Table Deletion

# MAGIC ## Requirements
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Please review the following requirements before starting the lesson:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * To run this notebook, you need to use one of the following Databricks runtime(s): **16.3.x-cpu-ml-scala2.12**

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Classroom Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before starting the lab, run the provided classroom setup script. This script will define configuration variables necessary for the lab. Execute the following cell:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Other Conventions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Throughout this demo, we'll refer to the object `DA`. This object, provided by Databricks Academy, contains variables such as your username, catalog name, schema name, working directory, and dataset locations. Run the code block below to view these details:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Data Preparation
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

## Set the path of the dataset
shared_volume_name = 'cdc-diabetes' ## From Marketplace
csv_name = 'diabetes_binary_5050split_BRFSS2015' ## CSV file name
dataset_path = f"/Volumes/mltraining/datasets/files/diabetes/diabetes_binary_5050split_BRFSS2015.csv" ## Full path
silver_df = spark.read.csv(dataset_path, header="true", inferSchema="true", multiLine="true", escape='"')
display(silver_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task1: Feature Selection
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The dataset is loaded and ready. We are assuming that most of the data cleaning and feature computation is already done and data is saved to "silver" table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Select these features from the dataset; **"HighBP", "HighChol", "BMI", "Stroke", "PhysActivity", "GenHlth", "Sex", "Age", "Education", "Income".**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Create a `UID` column to be used as primary key.

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import monotonically_increasing_id

## select features we are interested in
silver_df = <FILL_IN>

## drop the target column
silver_df = <FILL_IN>

## create an UID column to be used as primary key
silver_df = <FILL_IN>

display(silver_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Task 2: Create a Feature Table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Create a feature table from the `silver_df` dataset. Define description and tags as you wish.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC New feature table name must be **`diabetes_features`**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note:** Don't define partition column.

# COMMAND ----------

from databricks.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineeringClient

fe = <FILL_IN>

diabetes_table_name = <FILL_IN>

fe.create_table(<FILL_IN>)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Task 3: Explore Feature Table with the UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that the feature table is created, visit **Features** page from the left panel and review following information;
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Check table columns, identify **primary key** and **partition** columns.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * View **sample data**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * View table **details**. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * View **history**.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 4: Retrieve Feature Table Details
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Another way of accessing the feature table is using the API. Let's **list `features` and `primary_keys`** of the table.

# COMMAND ----------

ft = fe.<FILL_IN>
print(f"Features: {ft.<FILL_IN>}")
print(f"Primary Keys: {ft.<FILL_IN>}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 5: Create a Feature Table from an Existing UC Table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There is a table already created for you which includes diet related features. The table name is **`diet_features`**. Create a feature table for this existing table.

# COMMAND ----------

display(spark.sql("SELECT * FROM diet_features"))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC ---- set UID column to not null
# MAGIC <FILL_IN>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ---- set UID column as primary key constraint
# MAGIC <FILL_IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 6: Add New Features to Existing Table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's collect diet features and merge them to the existing `diabetes_features` table. As both tables has `UID` as unique identifier, we will merge them based on this column.

# COMMAND ----------

diet_features = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM diet_features")

## Update diabetes feature table by adding diet features table
fe.<FILL_IN>

## Read and display the merged feature table
display(fe.<FILL_IN>)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 7: Delete a Feature Table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We merged both feature tables and we no longer need the `diet_features` table. Thus, let's delete this table.

# COMMAND ----------

diet_table_name = f"{DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.diet_features"

## drop the table
fe.<FILL_IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, you demonstrated the use of Databricks Feature Store to perform feature engineering tasks. You executed the loading, preparation, and selection of features from a dataset, created a feature table, explored and accessed table details through both the UI and API, merged tables, and efficiently removed unnecessary ones. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This hands-on experience enhanced your feature engineering skills on the Databricks platform.
