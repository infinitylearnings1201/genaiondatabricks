# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC    - Click **More** in the drop-down.
# MAGIC    
# MAGIC    - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** window, use the first drop-down to select your unique cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.

# MAGIC ## Lab Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before starting the Lab, follow these initial steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Run the provided classroom setup script. This script will establish necessary configuration variables tailored to each user. Execute the following code cell:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Other Conventions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Throughout this lab, we'll make use of the object `DA`, which provides critical variables. Execute the code block below to see various variables that will be used in this notebook:

# COMMAND ----------

print(f"Username:          {DA.username}")
print(f"Catalog Name:      {DA.catalog_name}")
print(f"Schema Name:       {DA.schema_name}")
print(f"Working Directory: {DA.paths.working_dir}")
print(f"Dataset Location:  {DA.paths.datasets}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##Task 1: Read Data from Delta Table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC + Use Spark to read data from the Delta table into a DataFrame.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

## Load dataset with spark
shared_volume_name = 'telco' ## From Marketplace
csv_name = 'telco-customer-churn-missing' ## CSV file name
dataset_path = f"/Volumes/mltraining/datasets/files/telco/telco-customer-churn-missing.csv" ## Full path

## Read dataset with spark
telco_df = spark.read.csv(dataset_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)

table_name = "telco_missing"
table_name_bronze = f"{table_name}_bronze_lab"

## Write it as delta table
telco_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("mltraining.telco.telco_missing_bronze_lab")
telco_df.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##Task 2: Manage Data Permissions
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Establish controlled access to the Telco Delta table by granting specific permissions for essential actions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC + Grant permissions for specific actions (e.g., read, write) on the Delta table.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC ---- Write query to Grant Permission to all the users to access Delta Table
# MAGIC grant select on table `mltraining`.`telco`.`telco_missing_bronze_lab` to `account users`

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##Task 3: Show Summary Statistics
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Compute and present key statistical metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Telco dataset.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC + Utilize PySpark to compute and display summary statistics for the Telco dataset.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC + Include key metrics such as mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.

# COMMAND ----------

## Show summary of the Data
dbutils.data.summarize(telco_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##Task 4: Use Data Profiler to Explore DataFrame
# MAGIC Use the Data Profiler and Visualization Editor tools.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC + Use the Data Profiler to explore the structure, data types, and basic statistics of the DataFrame.
# MAGIC     - **Task 4.1.1:** Identify columns with missing values and analyze the percentage of missing data for each column.
# MAGIC     - **Task 4.1.2:** Review the data types of each column to ensure they match expectations. Identify any columns that might need type conversion.
# MAGIC + Use Visualization Editor to Check Outliers and Data Distributions:
# MAGIC     - **Task 4.2.1:** Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of churned and non-churned customers.
# MAGIC     - **Task 4.2.2:** Generate a pie chart to visualize the distribution of different contract types.
